# Hi there! 👋, I’m @gendikutech, a passionate full-stack web developer with a love for creating awesome digital experiences. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

💻 As a full-stack developer, I enjoy working on both the frontend and backend to build robust and scalable web applications. I have expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like Angular And Ionic for crafting beautiful user interfaces.

⚙️ On the backend, I have experience with PHP and frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, as well as working with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. I'm also skilled in building RESTful APIs and have dabbled in OAuth for efficient data retrieval.

🐳 Additionally, I'm well-versed in containerization using Docker, which helps streamline the deployment and management of my applications. I'm comfortable with version control using Git and frequently collaborate with teams to deliver high-quality code.

🌟 Over the years, I've worked on various projects, ranging from small personal websites to large-scale web applications. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
